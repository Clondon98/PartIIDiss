Introduction

- Brief introduction to gene expression data and how it can be used to classify (diseases, agriculture)
- Brief introduction to semi-supervised learning and why it's useful for biological data
- Brief introduction to autoencoders
- Related and previous work

Preparation

- (Very brief introduction to perceptrons)
- Introduction to autoencoders, denoising autoencoders, variational autoencoders - talk about manifold, intuition, maths
- Dimensionality reduction
- SDAE
- Kingma models
- Ladder
- Saliency - what it is
- MNIST dataset
- TCGA dataset
- why I chose to use Pytorch
- backing up and stuff

Implementation

- Concrete algorithm details for models
- Issues with code and how they were solved
- How the code can be used, etc (CLI)
- Reasons for using MNIST while implementing
- Hyperparameter selection - early stopping, layers, constant learning rate

Evaluation

- MNIST results
- comparison of models and explanation
- saliency maps (check if they're any good)

- TCGA results
- comparison and explanation
- saliency maps - compare most important genes with those found in other papers

Conclusion
