\section*{Declaration}

I, Charles London of Trinity College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose. 

I, Charles London of Trinity College, 
am content for my dissertation to be made available to the students and staff of the University.

\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of this project was to use a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning 
to train a model to predict the phenotype of an cell or group of cells using the genomic data.
The aim was then to build a simple command line tool that would train a model for the user without requiring them 
to know anything about machine learning.

\section*{Work Completed}

The project has compared semi-supervised learning methods, which combine supervised and unsupervised learning,
to find which performed best on a gene expression dataset. Using the information discovered during this comparison
a simple command line tool was constructed that can be used to perform semi-supervised learning on genomic data.

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
document on both Ubuntu Linux and OS X.
