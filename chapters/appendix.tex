\chapter{Backpropagation} \label{backprop}

Backpropagation is the flow of information from the outputs of the network back through the network. Once the cost function has been computed
finding the gradient of the loss with respect to each trainable parameter shows which direction the parameter can be shifted to decrease 
the loss function.. This derivation of the backpropagation algorithm is based on that found in \textit{Artificial intelligence I}~\cite{Art_Int}.
In the derivations below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $J(\vec{\theta})_k$ is the cost function for the $kth$ sample in the training set
  \item $w_{i \to j}$ is the weight between node $i$ and node $j$
  \item $a_j$ is the value computed by the node $j$ pre-activation ($\sum_{k} w_{k \to j} z_k$)
  \item $z_j$ and $y_j$ are the values post-activation ($\sigma(a_j)$), for non-output and output nodes respectively
\end{itemize}

The value to be calculated for each weight (per sample) is $\frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial w_{i \to j}}$. To do this we use the chain rule
of differentiation:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial w_{i \to j}} & = \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_j} \frac{\partial a_j}{\partial w_{i \to j}} \\
  & = \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_j} z_i
\end{align}

Then for weights connected to the output nodes:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial w_{i \to j}} & = \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_j} z_i \\
  & = \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial y_j} \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial a_j} z_i
\end{align}

If our loss function is differentiable with respect to $y_j$, and $y_j$ is differetiable with respect to $a_j$ then we can calculate this.  
For backpropagation to work all our loss and activation functions must have this property. Thankfully all the loss and activation functions 
shown in this dissertation do have that property and so work correctly with backpropagation.

Once the gradients are computed for the weights in the output layer it is possible to calculate them for the next layer, and then the
layer after that, etc., as the errors are backpropagated through the network. The computation for the hidden layers is slightly more 
complicated:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial w_{i \to j}} & = \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_j} z_i \\
  & = \left( \sum_{k \in K} \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_k} \frac{\partial a_k}{\partial a_j} \right) z_i
\end{align}
\begin{center}
  \textit{where K is the set of all nodes $j$ is connected to in the next layer}
\end{center}

By definition:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial a_k}{\partial a_j} & = \frac{\partial}{\partial a_j} \left( \sum_{i} w_{i \to k} z_i \right) \\
  & = \frac{\partial}{\partial a_j} \left( \sum_{i} w_{i \to k} \sigma(a_i) \right) \\
  & = w_{j \to k} \sigma'(a_j)
\end{align}

Therefore, for hidden layers:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial w_{i \to j}} & = \left( \sum_{k \in K} w_{j \to k} \frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_k} \right) \sigma'(a_j) z_i
\end{align}

As the errors are moving backward through the network, and all nodes $k$ are in the layer after $j$, $\frac{\partial J(\vec{\theta})_k}{\partial a_k}$
has already been computed and so this gradient can be calculated.

\begin{align}
  \log p(x) & = \log \int p(x|z)p(z) dz &\text{Law of total probability}\\
  & = \log \int p(x|z)p(z) \frac{q(z|x)}{q(z|x)} dz\\
  & = \log\left(\mathbb{E}_q \left[\frac{p(x|z)p(z)}{q(z|x)}\right]\right) \\

  & = \mathbb{E}_q [\log p(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z))
\end{align}

\chapter{The reparameterization trick} \label{reparam}

It is not possible to backpropagate the reconstruction loss of a varitaional autoencoder through the random sampling in the latent dimension, because the drawing of
the samples is not differentiable with respect to $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{\sigma}$. Previously this was solved using a Monte Carlo gradient estimator, but these have 
extremely high variance and are impractical.Instead the reparameterization trick allows the Gaussian sample to be reparameterized as:
\begin{align}
  \vec{z_{i}} = \vec{\mu} + \vec{\sigma}\vec{\epsilon}
\end{align}

$\vec{\epsilon}$ is a vector of samples from the standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The sampling operation is now differentiable
with respect to $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{\sigma}$ and therefore is differentiable with respect to $\vec{\theta}$, the trainable parameters of the encoder. As the
gradients can be backpropagated through the network it is possible to train the VAE using gradient descent.

\chapter{Derivation of semi-supervised VAE loss} \label{ssvae_loss}

For labelled data the model should maximise evidence $\log p(\vec{x}, y)$:
\begingroup
\allowdisplaybreaks
\begin{align*}
  \log p(x, y) & = \log \int p(x, y, z) dz \\
  & = \log \int p(x|y, z)p(y)p(z) dz \qquad \text{Independence of $z$ and $y$}\\
  & = \log \int p(x|y, z)p(y)p(z) \frac{q(z|x, y)}{q(z|x, y)} dz\\
  & = \log\left(\mathbb{E}_q \left[\frac{p(x|y, z)p(y)p(z)}{q(z|x, y)}\right]\right) \\
  & \geq \mathbb{E}_q \left[\log\frac{p(x|y, z)p(y)p(z)}{q(z|x, y)}\right] \\
  & = \mathbb{E}_q \left[\log p(x|y, z) + \log p(y) + \log\frac{p(z)}{q(z|x, y)}\right] \\
  & = \mathbb{E}_q [\log p(x|y, z) + \log p(y)] - D_{KL}(q(z|x, y)||p(z)) \\
  & = -\mathcal{L}(x, y)
\end{align*}
\endgroup

For unlabelled data the model should maximise $\log p(\vec{x})$:
\begingroup
\allowdisplaybreaks
\begin{align*}
  \log p(x) & = \log \sum_{y} \int p(x, y, z) dz \\
  & = \log \sum_{y} \int p(x, y, z) \frac{q(z, y|x)}{q(z, y|x)} dz\\
  & = \log \sum_{y} \int p(x, y, z) \frac{q(z|x, y)q(y|x)}{q(z|x, y)q(y|x)} dz\\
  & \geq \sum_{y} q(y|x) \int q(z|x, y) \log\frac{p(x, y, z)}{q(z|x, y)q(y|x)} dz \qquad \text{Jensen's inequality}\\
  & = \sum_{y} q(y|x) \int q(z|x, y) \log\frac{p(x, y, z)}{q(z|x, y)} dz - \sum_{y} q(y|x) \log q(y|x) \int q(z|x, y) dz\\
  & = \sum_{y} q(y|x)(-\mathcal{L}(x, y)) + \mathcal{H}(q(y|x)) \\
  & = -\mathcal{U}(x, y)
\end{align*}
